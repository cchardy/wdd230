            <h2>Alma 7:23</h2>
            <p>And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of
                patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments
                of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always
                returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.</p>

            <h2>3 Nephi 11:10-11</h2>
            <p>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world. <br> And behold, I am
                the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given
                me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered
                the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.</p>
